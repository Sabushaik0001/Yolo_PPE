## Project Overview
This document summarizes the technical work conducted on the PPE Detection project implemented with YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. The project aims to accurately detect personal protective equipment in various environments to enhance safety protocols.

## Key Components
- **Dataset Preparation:** Collected and annotated datasets for training and testing the model, ensuring a diverse representation of PPE types and environmental settings.
- **Model Selection and Training:** Selected the YOLO model for its effectiveness in real-time object detection. The model was trained on the prepared dataset, optimizing hyperparameters for improved performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Conducted evaluations using precision, recall, and F1-score to gauge model effectiveness. Implemented k-fold cross-validation for robust performance metrics.
- **Deployment:** Developed a deployment strategy for integrating the model into existing safety systems, considering hardware and software requirements.

## Conclusion
The YOLO-based PPE detection system demonstrates significant potential for enhancing workplace safety through automated monitoring. Further work would involve expanding the dataset and refining the model to cover more scenarios.
